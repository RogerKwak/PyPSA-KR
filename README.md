# PyPSA-KR: An open-source energy system modelling of Korean electricity network

Working in Process

- Introduce the PyPSA model to Korea for the first time by developing PyPSA-KR and conducting an in-depth analysis of Korean energy system.
- PyPSA is an open-source energy system model which is useful for regional grid analysis and optimization due to its high spatial and temporal resolution
- Derive Korean renewable energy potential and power system by PyPSA-KR and validate with historical data
- This research presents a systematic approach for expanding renewable energy, transmission, and ESS along with their deployment strategies that contributes to the national long-term energy strategy
