Trigger	 Description
``nH``; i.e. ``2H``-``6H``	 Resample the time-resolution by averaging over every ``n`` snapshots
``nSEG``; e.g. ``4380SEG``	 Apply time series segmentation with `tsam <https://tsam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ package to ``n`` adjacent snapshots of varying lengths based on capacity factors of varying renewables  hydro inflow and load.
``Co2L``	 Add an overall absolute carbon-dioxide emissions limit configured in ``electricity: co2limit``. If a float is appended an overall emission limit relative to the emission level given in ``electricity: co2base`` is added (e.g. ``Co2L0.05`` limits emissisions to 5% of what is given in ``electricity: co2base``)
``REM``	 Add regional carbon-dioxide emissions limits configured in ``electricity: regional_Co2_limits``. These can be specified in the file linked at ``electricity: regional_Co2_limits`` in the configuration. File defaults to ``repo_data/regional_co2_limits.csv``.
``RPS``	Add Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) constraints to shares of generator production (MWh) per carrier for individual countries. Standards can be set for single carriers or groups of carriers. Each constraint can be designated for a specified planning horizon in multi-period models. Opts and path for portfolio_standards.csv must be defined
``SAFE``	 Add a capacity reserve margin of a certain fraction above the peak demand to which renewable generators and storage do *not* contribute. Ignores network.
``SAFER``	Adds Regional Capacity Reserve Margin (SAFE) Constraints for defined region- set to a percentage above peak demand level for which renewables and storage do not contribute to. 
``Ep``	 Add cost for a carbon-dioxide price configured in ``costs: emission_prices: co2`` to ``marginal_cost`` of generators (other emission types listed in ``network.carriers`` possible as well)
``CCL``	Add minimum or maximum levels of generator nominal capacity per carrier for individual countries. Each constraint can be designated for a specified planning horizon in multi-period models. Opts and path for agg_p_nom_minmax.csv must be defined
``EQ``	 "Require each country or node to on average produce a minimal share of its total consumption itself. Example: ``EQ0.5c`` demands each country to produce on average at least 50% of its consumption; ``EQ0.5`` demands each node to produce on average at least 50% of its consumption."
``ATK``	 "Require each node to be autarkic. Example: ``ATK`` removes all lines and links. ``ATKc`` removes all cross-border lines and links."
``BAU``	 Add a per-``carrier`` minimal overall capacity; i.e. at least ``40GW`` of ``OCGT`` in Europe; configured in ``electricity: BAU_mincapacities``
``carrier+{c|p|m}factor``	Alter the capital cost (``c``), installable potential (``p``) or marginal costs (``m``) of a carrier by a factor. Example: ``solar+c0.5`` reduces the capital cost of solar to 50\% of original values.
``CH4L``	Add an overall absolute gas limit. If configured in ``electricity: gaslimit`` it is given in MWh thermal, if a float is appended, the overall gaslimit is assumed to be given in TWh thermal (e.g. ``CH4L200`` limits gas dispatch to 200 TWh termal)
